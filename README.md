# Youtube

This is a small chrome extenstion for saving YouTube videos with exact timestamp. 

- You can save video by clicking on save button. If video is already in your saved list, the timestamp will update. 
- You can delete a video by right clicking on a video in the list, and then click on delete button.

### Update 26/02/23

- Added possibility to add and delete folders.
- All folders must have unique names.
- When a folder is selected and the __save__ button is pressed, the currently opened video will be saved under the selected folder.
- If the video was already saved in another folder, it will be moved to the currently selected folder.
- Global folder __All__ will contain all the videos.
- It is possible to delete a folder by pressing the right mouse button once, and when the folder changes the color to red, press the left mouse button to perform deletion.
- When a folder is deleted, all the videos from the deleted folder will still be available in the __All__ folder.
